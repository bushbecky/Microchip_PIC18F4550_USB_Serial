Well Shane, I finally got it to work with version 9.51PL3. I turned off assembly 
optimizations for the file usbctrltrf.c and all compiled properly. I did not get 
to test compilation with your compiler yet [Hi-Tech C - 8.35PL3 - Ed.].

One other thing I found out is that the PICDEM bootloader software for the PC 
(the one that comes with the board.) expects to get its intelhex as INHEX032. 
This can be achieved by selecting build options for the project, selecting the 
custom build tab, ticking the post-build step and putting the following  line in 
the command line box. c:\program files\hi-tech Software\picc-
18\std\9.51\bin\hexmate.exe hexfilename.hex -FORMAT=INHX032 -
Obootloadercompatible.hex

To offset the code to 0x800, click the linker tab and put 800 in the codeoffset 
box.

Thanks once again for all your help & I hope the above is useful to you.

Joe
